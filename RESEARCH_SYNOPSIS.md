## **Title:** An AI-Driven Platform for Enhancing Transparency and Efficiency in the Construction Contractor Marketplace

---

### **Abstract**

The traditional construction and specialized trade industry is often characterized by information asymmetry, inefficient project management, and a fragmented process for hiring and managing contractors. This leads to project delays, budget overruns, and a lack of transparency for all stakeholders. This research proposes the design, implementation, and evaluation of **Geo 3D Hub**, a novel, integrated web platform that leverages artificial intelligence to address these challenges. The platform facilitates a transparent marketplace for clients and contractors, incorporating AI-powered tools for smart contractor matching, automated project roadmap generation, and predictive performance analytics. By structuring interactions and injecting data-driven intelligence, Geo 3D Hub aims to demonstrate a significant improvement in project success rates, hiring efficiency, and stakeholder trust. This paper details the system architecture, the AI model integration, and the data-driven workflows that form the core of this solution, presenting a model for the future of digitalized construction management.

### **1. Introduction**

The gig economy has transformed numerous sectors, yet the construction and skilled trades industry has been slower to adopt integrated digital platforms that go beyond simple listings. The process of finding, vetting, and managing contractors remains a significant pain point for clients, while contractors face challenges in finding a consistent stream of relevant projects (Sundararajan, 2017). Existing platforms often act as mere directories, failing to provide deep project management support or intelligent matching. This research addresses this gap by developing Geo 3D Hub, a platform that not only connects clients and contractors but also embeds AI into the core project lifecycle—from planning and hiring to monitoring and completion.

### **2. Problem Statement**

The key problems this research aims to solve are:
1.  **Inefficient Contractor Discovery:** Clients struggle to find contractors with the specific, verified skills required for their projects, often relying on word-of-mouth or unverified online profiles.
2.  **Lack of Project Planning & Oversight:** Many projects are initiated with poorly defined scopes and timelines, leading to disputes and failures. Clients and managers lack effective tools for monitoring real-time progress.
3.  **Information Asymmetry:** Contractors may have difficulty showcasing their true expertise and project history, while clients lack reliable data to predict a contractor's suitability for a job.
4.  **Administrative Overhead:** Significant manual effort is required for project planning, work allocation, and progress reporting.

### **3. Proposed Solution: Geo 3D Hub**

Geo 3D Hub is a monolithic web application built on the Next.js framework, utilizing MongoDB for data persistence and Google's Gemini models via Genkit for its intelligence layer.

**Core Features:**
*   **Role-Based Access:** Differentiated interfaces and permissions for Clients, Contractors, and Administrators.
*   **Smart Contractor Matching:** An AI flow that analyzes project requirements and suggests the most suitable contractors based on their skills, location, and performance history.
*   **AI-Generated Project Roadmaps:** A generative AI tool that takes a high-level project description and automatically produces a detailed, editable roadmap with phases and milestones, providing a structured plan from day one.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** AI-driven analysis of contractor profiles to forecast performance and likely project success, offering clients a data-backed layer of trust.
*   **Centralized Project Management:** A unified dashboard for tracking project status, progress, and communications.

### **4. Research Objectives & Questions**

This project seeks to answer the following research questions:
*   **RQ1:** To what extent can an AI-driven matching system improve the efficiency and perceived quality of hiring in the construction trade market compared to traditional listing platforms?
*   **RQ2:** How does an AI-generated project roadmap influence project planning, scope definition, and stakeholder alignment at the outset of a project?
*   **RQ3:** Can predictive performance analytics increase client trust and satisfaction during the contractor selection process?
*   **RQ4:** What are the key architectural and data model considerations for successfully integrating generative AI into a project management platform?

### **5. Methodology**

The research follows a **Design Science** methodology.
1.  **Problem Identification:** Analysis of existing literature and market gaps (as outlined above).
2.  **Solution Design:** Architecting the Geo 3D Hub platform using Next.js, MongoDB, and Genkit. Key to this is the design of Zod schemas to ensure structured and reliable data exchange with the AI models.
3.  **Implementation:** Building the core features of the platform, including the AI flows (`generateProjectRoadmap`, `predictContractorPerformance`, etc.).
4.  **Evaluation:** The platform's effectiveness will be evaluated through a combination of system-logged metrics (e.g., time-to-hire, project completion rates) and qualitative user feedback from a pilot group of clients and contractors.

### **6. Potential Contributions**

This research is expected to contribute:
*   A validated architectural model for integrating generative AI into complex project management workflows.
*   Empirical insights into how AI-powered tools can enhance trust and efficiency in online labor markets.
*   A practical, open-source reference application (Geo 3D Hub) for future research and development in the digital construction space.
